The Table
=========

   "You're here because you know something. What you know you can't explain,
   but you feel it"
   -- Morpheus, The Matrix

This functionality of the application is basically to visualize the values stored in the workflow. Only a subset of rows and all available columns are shown in its default format as shown in the following figure.

   :align: center
   :width: 100%

As in the case of :ref:`the columns<columns>`, the table is shown broken into
pages (you may choose the number of entries per page in the upper left side of the table) and allows to search for values. The icons in the left side of each row allow you to edit any of the values or delete a row entirely. If the *Add row* operation is selected a form with one field per column is shown. The values entered in this form will be checked to verify that the unique key property of the columns is preserved.

Due to the potential large size of this table in either number of rows or columns, OnTask offers the possibility of defining *views*. A view is simply a set of columns selected to visualize, and optionally, a filter that selects a subset of rows.

You may define several views for the workflow.

And select to see the table values corresponding to one view

The same page also allows to download the content of the whole table in CSV format.
