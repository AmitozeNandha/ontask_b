The Workflow
------------

    "But anyone who has experienced flow knows that the deep enjoyment it
    provides requires an equal degree of disciplined concentration."
    -â€• Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

The workflow in OnTask is simply a container that brings together the matrix,
the operations to upload the data, and the actions to create the
personalised content. The initial screen in OnTask shows the available
workflows as shown in the following figure.

Clicking in the OnTask icon in the upper left corner brings you back to the list of workflows from any page in the application. Clicking in the icon in the upper right corner opens the documentation page.

The screen includes three operations:

.. sidebar:: Going back

   Remember that clicking in the icon in the upper left corner *closes* the workflow and you see the list of available workflows again.

1. Create a new workflow: Clicking in the *New Workflow* button will ask you for the name and description of the element.

2. Importing a file containing a previously exported workflow. Clicking in the *Import* button will ask you for the new for the new workflow, the file and will let you choose to import only the data, or the data and the actions as shown in the following figure

3. Open a workflow to work on it. This is perhaps the most common initial step. Once you open or *enter* a worklow, all the operations are applied to that context. The platform will remind you in which workflow you are working by inserting its name right under the top navigation bar as shown in the following figure.

Once you open a workflow, it is locked and no other user can manipulate it (see :ref:`sharing a workflow <details_sharing>`.
