=================

OnTask is built in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ using the web framework `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ in combination with some additional libraries such as `Django REST Framework <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_, `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, etc. The application is available as `open source <https://github.com/abelardopardo/ontask_b>`_ with `MIT License <https://github.com/abelardopardo/ontask_b/blob/master/LICENSE>`_. This means that the advanced users can get a copy of the source code and modify it to suite their needs using the already existing models and functions.

The API (Application Programming Interface)
-------------------------------------------

OnTask is a platform that facilitates the connection between data and the
provision of personalised learner support actions. The higher the quality of
the data the higher number of possible effective support actions. This means
that OnTask should facilitate the connection with already existing data
sources so that it can combine data sets and create a comprehensive view of
how a learning experience is evolving.

The API is documented online through the url suffix ``apidoc``. The page
contains the description of every entry point available with the required
parameters.
