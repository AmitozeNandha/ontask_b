Welcome to OnTask, the platform offering teachers and educational designers
the capacity to use data to personalise the experience for the learners.

Learning is complex, highly situated, and requires interacting with peers,
instructors, resources, platforms, etc. This complexity can be alleaviated
providing learners with the right support actions. But this process becomes
increasingly complex when the number of learners grows. The more learners,
the more difficult is for instructors to provide support and the usual
solution is to provide generic resources that are only relevant to a subset
of the audience (think reminder about upcoming assessment deadline).

In parallel wih this increase in complexity, learning platforms now generate
a wealth of data about those interactions that are technology mediated. This
data can be collected and used to help instructors and designers to provide a
truly personalised experience. Why is this not hapenning in current
platforms? Because the connection between this data and learner support
actions is very challenging to implement. This is the focus of OnTask:
provide instructors and designers with a platform to connect data emerging
from learning environments with highly personalised student support actions.

The rest of the document is divided into two blocks. The :ref:`first block
<install>` covers the technical details to download, install and configure
the tool. It requires technological expertise and access to the adequate
computing facilities (a virtual machine, a server, or similar). The main
audience of this part is system administrators and advanced users that want
to use the tool within their institution or for their own use.

The :ref:`second part <using>` explains how to use OnTask in the context of a
learning experience, how to load data, manipulate the matrix and create
the personalised actions. The audience for this part is teachers and
designers that need to personalise the interactions they have with learners
in a platform offering some data sources.

Why OnTask? There are several platforms out there that implement similar
functionality, and the common thread is the positive impact that personalised
communication may have when supporting learners. There are a few scientific
publications that document the ideas and processes that inspired the creation
of OnTask:
